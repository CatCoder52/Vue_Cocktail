# VueCocktails - Cocktails database app using Vue

## Project Briefing

This is a cocktails database app created in Vue 2 powered by tailwind css and vue-tailwind package. This app using data from the Cocktail Database API. Here is the link of their open source API. https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php. Please support them, in my knowledge it's one of the easiest APIs to use with no authentication. 

This app would have information related to tons of delicious cocktails around the globe including their ingredients, whether they're alcoholic in nature or not and what glass they're served in.

## Built With

* [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/)

### Deployment to Heroku

This project was deployed on Heroku on 14th November 2021. Deployment through Heroku is a smooth process which required installation of express and serve-static libraries for Node.
Then, I added a 'postbuild' script and a 'start' script to build production files and serve it through an express server.
Below is the app link.
